## Car Price Predictor

### My Project

This project is a Car Price Predictor built using machine learning techniques. It helps users estimate the price of a car based on its attributes, such as model, company, year of manufacture, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The predictor leverages data preprocessing and a trained machine learning model to provide price predictions.
